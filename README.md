## Background
Currently pursuing an M.Tech in Robotics and Mobility Systems at IIT Jodhpur, I am deeply committed to integrating advanced robotics with agricultural practices to drive innovation and sustainability. My journey from Agricultural Entrepreneur and Manager to robotics engineer reflects a focused dedication to leveraging technology for transformative impact in agriculture.

With a B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering, I bring a robust foundation in engineering principles that enhances my approach to developing efficient, eco-friendly solutions. My experience at NestlÃ©, where I optimized warehouse layouts to boost productivity, further honed my skills in industrial engineering. I am proficient in Mathematical Modeling and Simulation, ROS, Sensor Integration, Robot Programming, Path Planning, Computer Vision, Artificial Intelligence, experimental research, and data analysis. I hold certifications and have completed projects in MATLAB, Python, Machine Learning, and SOLIDWORKS, which equip me to tackle the complexities of robotics applications.

I am passionate about advancing agricultural standards through cutting-edge robotics, striving to create sustainable solutions that address global challenges and have a lasting impact on the industry.

## Projects

### [Development of an Underwater Vehicle and Depth Control System through Active Buoyancy Management]()
**Date:** May 2024  
Developing a capsule capable of floating and operating underwater, utilizing buoyancy management techniques. This capsule will be integrated with an amphibious drone, enabling it to function in the air, on water, and underwater.  
**Tools & Technologies Used:** Matlab, SolidWorks, Robot Operating System, Arduino, Sensor Integration
