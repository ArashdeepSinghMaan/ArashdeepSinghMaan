## Background
Currently pursuing an M.Tech in Robotics and Mobility Systems at IIT Jodhpur, I am deeply committed to integrating advanced robotics with agricultural practices to drive innovation and sustainability. My journey from Agricultural Entrepreneur and Manager to robotics engineer reflects a focused dedication to leveraging technology for transformative impact in agriculture.

With a B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering, I bring a robust foundation in engineering principles that enhances my approach to developing efficient, eco-friendly solutions. My experience at NestlÃ©, where I optimized warehouse layouts to boost productivity, further honed my skills in industrial engineering. I am proficient in Mathematical Modeling and Simulation, ROS, Sensor Integration, Robot Programming, Path Planning, Computer Vision, Artificial Intelligence, experimental research, and data analysis. I hold certifications and have completed projects in MATLAB, Python, Machine Learning, and SOLIDWORKS, which equip me to tackle the complexities of robotics applications.

I am passionate about advancing agricultural standards through cutting-edge robotics, striving to create sustainable solutions that address global challenges and have a lasting impact on the industry.

## Projects

### [Development of Multi-Agent
Coordination and Control for
Surface and Underwater Vehicles](https://github.com/ArashdeepSinghMaan/Development-of-Multi-Agent-Coordination-and-Control-for-Surface-and-Underwater-Vehicles)
**Date:** May 2024  
# Objectives

- **Modeling of AUV, ASV**: 
    - Creating accurate models to represent both the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and the autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) dynamics is crucial for simulating real-world behavior, enabling effective depth and orientation control.

- **Control with Obstacle Avoidance**: 
    - Developing control systems to maintain stability, avoid obstacles, and transition between modes ensures safe and efficient operation.

- **Multi-Agent Architecture for AUVs**:
    - **Task Switching and Priority-Based Allocation**: Enable each AUV to take on roles based on its capabilities, allowing for dynamic task switching and reallocation based on mission priorities. This will maximize resource utilization and ensure that high-priority tasks receive attention from the most capable agents.
    - **Leader-Follower Control Strategy**: Implementing a leader-follower setup will create efficient coordination in complex environments, ensuring a lead AUV can guide the group while followers maintain formation. This approach enhances mission cohesion and simplifies multi-agent movement through challenging areas.
    - **Inter-Agent Communication**: A reliable communication system among AUVs is essential for sharing real-time data on position, task status, and environmental changes. This will support adaptive decision-making, allowing agents to respond collectively to evolving mission conditions.
    - **Obstacle Avoidance and Navigation**: Equipping AUVs with autonomous obstacle detection and avoidance ensures safe operation and efficient navigation. This capability will be critical for uninterrupted multi-agent operations in dynamic underwater environments.

- **Hardware Development and Deployment**: 
    - Building and integrating reliable hardware that can withstand dual-environment operations is essential, especially given the added challenge of balancing the combined vehicle-drone system for optimal aerial and aquatic performance.

**Tools & Technologies Used:** Matlab, SolidWorks, Robot Operating System, Arduino, Sensor Integration
