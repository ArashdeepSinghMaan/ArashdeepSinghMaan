###Projects
â€¢ ** Development of an Underwater Vehicle and Depth Control System through Active Buoyancy Management ** May 2024
Developing a capsule capable of floating and working underwater. This capsule works on buoyancy management.
This capsule will be integrated with an amphibious drone, allowing it to work in air, on water, and underwater.
Tools & technologies used: Matlab, Solidworks, Robot Operating System,Arduino,Sensor Integration
â€¢** Perception of Unknown Environment, Path Planning, Obstacle Avoidance, and Autonomous Navigation **
The aim of this project was to create a campus like environment in gazebo. Then using a robot first sense this
environment and make a map of this environment. Robot will open to environmental changes. After perception
robot will do path planning in the campus. The main work of the robot will be to guide others to move from one
location to another. It is simulation based project for Autonomus Systems.
â€¢ **Leader-Follower Formation Control of Non-Holonomic Mobile Robots**
The key aspects of the project are: Understanding the kinematics of differential drive wheeled mobile robots
(WMRs), Modeling the leader-follower formation using relative distance and angle between robots,Designing
Lyapunov-based controllers for position, velocity, and orientation control, Simulating line and circular formations
using the derived control laws
Skills: Robotic Kinematics, Formation Control, Lyapunov Stability Analysis, Simulation and Visualization using
Matlab, Problem-Solving and Mathematical Modeling
â€¢** Voice-Controlled Smart Home Automation System with Sensor Integration**
Developed a voice-controlled smart home system using an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense microcontroller. The key
features included implementing a word recognition system for appliance control, integrating environmental sensors
(temperature, humidity, light), utilizing relays to connect low-power signals to appliances, and deploying machine
learning models with TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers. The result was an intelligent, sensor-driven home
automation solution.
Skills:Hardware-Software Integration,Voice Recognition,Machine Learning Integration,Sensor
Integration,Embedded System Design
â€¢** Underwater Pipeline Detection using computer vision**
Designed and Implemented a Novel Pipeline: Integrated a range of computer vision algorithms and filters
including LAB color space conversion, Gaussian blurring, adaptive histogram equalization, Canny edge detection,
morphological operations, probabilistic Hough transform, and adaptive region of interest selection, leading to
improved detection accuracy.
